## Click Fraud Analysis

# Overview
• Investigated the journey of users’ clicks behaviors to detect click fraud and predicted whether clicks on the mobile ads will lead to app download

•	Performed dimension reduction using PCA, and model selection among various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic, LDA, KNN, CART, SVM, and Random Forest; results in the ROC-AUC score of 0.9907

# Background
In the modern world where people spend significant amounts of time online, businesses invest a lot of money studying users’ online browsing behaviors and digital advertising to drive up the revenues. However, according to Forrester, 69% of brands spending $1 million on a monthly basis reported that at least 20% of their budgets were being lost due to digital ad fraud (Boutcher, 2020).

This project is to identify and help prevent the mobile ad fraud in the digital advertising industry using data from TalkingData, one of the world's largest independent big data service platforms, covering over 70% of active mobile devices nationwide. Essentially, we suspected that the IP addresses that have multiple click activities but failed to download the app are potentially fraudulent.
